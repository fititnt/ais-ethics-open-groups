## [Artificial Intelligence Stack Exchange](https://ai.stackexchange.com/)
> Artificial Intelligence Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for
people interested in AI theory, mathematics, research, discovery, design,
development, practice, embedded uses, cognition, policy, and impact. It's
built and run by you as part of the Stack Exchange network of Q&A sites. With

## [EthicsNet](http://forum.ethicsnet.com/)
> EthicsNet, a non-profit, is building a community with the purpose of
co-creating examples of nice behaviours, to help socialise A.I. (...)
We want to do the same for the space of kind behaviours â€“ a massive
collaboration efforts to construct, collate, and annotate a range of datasets
that reflect many different cultures, opinions and creeds, and which can expand
in scope and nuance over time, to empower socially-aware thinking machines for
generations to come.

>>> Strong Artificial Intelligence (Facebook Group)

    Reason: the description of the group says:
            "A.I. critics are not allowed here and will be eliminated from
             this group. Discussing whether creating super intelligent
             machines is ethical or not is a profound waste of time."
