### Artificial Intelligence Stack Exchange

> Artificial Intelligence Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for
people interested in AI theory, mathematics, research, discovery, design,
development, practice, embedded uses, cognition, policy, and impact. It's
built and run by you as part of the Stack Exchange network of Q&A sites. With
your help, we're working together to build a library of detailed answers to
every question about artificial intelligence.

### EthicsNet

> EthicsNet, a non-profit, is building a community with the purpose of
co-creating examples of nice behaviours, to help socialise A.I. (...)
We want to do the same for the space of kind behaviours â€“ a massive
collaboration efforts to construct, collate, and annotate a range of datasets
that reflect many different cultures, opinions and creeds, and which can expand
in scope and nuance over time, to empower socially-aware thinking machines for
generations to come.

## Non-English

### Need your help!

#### Suggest a new Open Group
If you know potential candidates to non-English open groups, [send
your suggestion](#contributions).

#### Help to found a new Open Group
Even if you (on this date) does not consider yourself yet with _good_ knowledge of
artificial intelligence and/or ethics, but have experience as moderator on
forums and is open to accept external help from other parts of the world to
give a great bootstrap on your regional community, send one e-mail to
<rocha@ieee.org>. Let's talk.

And it's ok if you do not know well the English language or have have other
challanges than on average people who works with IT tend to ignore. On some
closed groups on Africa we use machine translation and moderators contribute
even from phones with limited bandwidth and/or using Facebook with zero-rating.

# Other Groups

In addition to the suggested [Open Groups](#open-groups), these links below are
potential candidates, but are not suggested by default at this time as they are
still under review (e.g. the autor of this repository is following each one).

One potential issue (that in fact was very common on references that are not
even listed here) is that some open groups related to artificial intelligence
seems to be unfriendly to non machine learning / deep learning / "how to use
this tool" discussions.

    Reason: the description of the group says:
            "A.I. critics are not allowed here and will be eliminated from
             this group. Discussing whether creating super intelligent
             machines is ethical or not is a profound waste of time."

# What to do next?

## Read A/IS Standards

A suggested starting point is [ais-ethics-standards](https://github.com/fititnt/ais-ethics-standards).

## Participate on A/IS Ethics "Closed" Groups

Some organizations that already work with A/IS Ethics may also have discussion
forums which, by having some additional requirement (for example, being an
university student or already a specialist in one area), are not on this
list because are considered "Closed" Groups.

A suggested starting point is [ais-ethics-orgs](https://github.com/fititnt/ais-ethics-orgs).

## Participate on a existent open group or create a new

### Reasons to promote A/IS Ethics Open Groups
A/IS Ethics is a transdisciplinary area. Even in fewer regions of the
world where the artificial intelligence development (_e.g. **how to do this?
(implementation)**_) has more academic and professional experts (mostly likely
because of decades of government investment and growth of the local high tech
industry), the engajement of people outside of computer science field to discuss
implementations and even standards of A/IS Ethics (e.g. _**should we do this?
(rights vs wrong)**_) could be higher. So, how more
challanging could in the rest of the world?

Activism (both anti and pro some A/IS specific implementation) to promote more
immediate changes in a society using argumentations that the _averange person_
could agree can sometimes lead to negative effect on social well-being.

<!--

### The challenge of self-doubt

Even experts outside computer science can have fear to express their opinion even when is what could better anwser

(...)

### Activism can be a double-edged sword
To make it clear upfront: we should respect people who do activism to promote
more immediate changes and **act in good faith**, even if we strongly disagree.

But assume that is likely to take some time to be respected back, as some
counter-argumentations we have to deal could be a result of what they deal
in figths (argumentations) we're not able to see.
